# Projects That I've Done

<!-- TODO: Photos, goal of <100KB each, or optional load-photos -->

## Ongoing Projects

<!-- TODO Snippets photo -->

[**Python Snippets**](https://gitlab.com/lynnpepin/some_snippets), ongoing, Python. A small collection of mostly-Python snippets, tricks, or writeups. Sometimes for others benefit, sometimes because I can't remember exact syntax.

<!-- TODO Blog photo -->

[**This blog**](https://gitlab.com/lynnpepin/diy-static-site-generator), ongoing, Python, HTML, CSS. Using Pandoc as the backbone, this is a Python-driven static site generator.


## Research Publications


## Finished Proof-of-Concepts

These are a collection of proof-of-concept projects that I did to teach myself a new skill or out of curiosity! Source code is provided, so feel free to poke around.

<!-- TODO Rolling Log photo -->

[**Rolling Log "Animal Crossing" shader**](https://gitlab.com/lynnpepin/rollinglogshader), 2020, Godot. This is a simple vertex shader that recreates the "rolling log" effect that is popular in the Animal Crossing series.

<!-- TODO Reso photo -->

[**Reso**](https://gitlab.com/lynnpepin/reso), 2018, Python. is a graph-automata circuit-programming language inspired by redstone and wireworld. It is Turing complete, but not very pretty to use. I might revisit this as an interactive, web-based JavaScript situation. 

<!-- TODO RGBLife, Brainbow -->

[RGBLife](https://gitlab.com/lynnpepin/RGBLife) and [Brainbow](https://gitlab.com/lynnpepin/brainbow-ca), 2017-2018, Python. These are two different four-state cellular automata with some neat behavior. I learned ["test-driven development" (TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) on these projects-- I highly recommend it! 

## Finished Projects

<!-- TODO NLP photo -->

**NLP for autoamted testing**, 2017-2018, Python, Keras, spaCy. A senior design team project I completed UConn with other students. I worked as engineering team lead as we worked on a tool to process human-language testing instructions to automatable tests.
