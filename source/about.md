And here are some website opinions I should have that'll influence this site:

* JavaScript should be minimal!
    * This is easy because I'm not so good at JavaScript.
* Tracking should also be minimal!
* The smaller the memory footprint, the better!
* Eventually have an RSS feed! (Mine doesn't!)

And here are some software things I think are really cool or fascinating or fun or generally worth blogging about:
