## About the Author

I'm a graduate student seeking my PhD at the University of Connecticut. 


### Software I like to use and how long I've used it.

I'm not trying to brag, but these softwares been the center of my career / hobbies. I might post about them sometime. When I list years of experience, I'm estimating how many 400 hours I've spent using the tool (i.e. 10 hours a week, 40 weeks a year.)

| Software | Relevance | Years of experience |
| - | - | - |
| [GameMaker](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker) | is how I started learning to program! I made some projects in it when I was young. | 6 years |
| [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/) | is what I generally use for game projects nowadays. | 2 years |
| [GNU Image Manipulation Program](https://www.gimp.org/) | is a photo-editing / art software that I use extensively! | 6 years |
| [AutoCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/) | was my first 3D modeling experience. I learned this in highschool! | 4 years |
| | Also, AutoDesk Inventor and Solidworks. I don't use them anymore though. | |
| [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) | is what I use now, but I'm still a novice. | 1 years
| [Signal Messenger](https://signal.org/) | is an easy-to-use end-to-end encrypted messenger using the Whisper protocol. | N/A |
