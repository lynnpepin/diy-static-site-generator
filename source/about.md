you've visited the cyber home of `lynn pepin`, or `lynndotpy`. here's a quick timeline that explains what's up with me:

(todo, tailwind / inline css to make this pretty)


> - `2004` : **metroid era:** I got really, REALLY into the Metroid videogame series. Around this time, my dad gave me a CD with ZSNES and a zillion ROMs. For a brief time, I truly believed my Dad worked at Nintendo, and I told this to other children.
> - `2005` : **gamedev era:** Started making Game Maker games! From this, I learned GIMP for sprites and art, SketchUp for 3D modeling, AnvilStudio for MIDIs. 
> - `2006` : **internet mod era:** Started hosting internet forums, becoming terminally online and learning Moderation Lessons at a single-digit age. I created a moderately succesful font. I first started dabbling with *javascript*, staining my soul forever.
> - `2010` : **engineer era:** Started learning computer-aided drafting, making my first 3D prints.
> - `2011` : **linux era:** Got into this "Linux" thing to save my ancient laptop. Wow! Firefox and Chrome and Gimp were so fast! So much software at my fingeripts with `apt`! I have multiple desktops? I can put it on a cube and light my windows on fire? Amazing!
> - `2012` : **python era:** I first started dabbling with Bash and Python around this time, so I could dump and crawl Homestuck. I refuse to describe this as my 'homestuck era'.
> - `2013` : 
> - `2014` : **activist era:** I participated in my first protest, the 2014 People's Climate March in New York City
> - `2015` : **tutor era:** Started professionally tutoring, specifically in calculus, physics, chemistry, CS, and programming languages.
> - `2016` : **intern era:** I had my first internship at 2016, picking up Ada, Godot, OpenGL, C, C++, RHEL, and a bunch of other skills. This is when I first heard of the niche language 'Rust'.
> - `2017` : 
> - `2018` : 
> - `2019` : **sysadmin era:** I had all these Linux skills, but I never set up my own site! I decided to learn one day, going through the whole domain/vps/nginx/apache rigamarol. 
> - `2019` : **cryptography era:** I took a bunch of network security and cryptography courses in this year, learning fun facts!
> - `2020` : **webdev era:** I started this year hosting my own Nextcloud instance, and ended it building my first static-site generator!
> - `2021` : **speaker era:** Presented the `reso` circuit language at !!Con 2021, marking my first time speaking professionally.
> - `2022` : **dropout era:** Dropped out of a CS PhD, having had learned lessons in implementing and creating neural networks (and other ML models), cryptography, and network security. I have finally completed my goal of being a dropout, after an incredibly succesful high-GPA academic career.



My name is Lynn Pepin (they/them). I'm a computer scientist grad student seeking my PhD at the Univerity of Connecticut! I do research and work a lot in Python, and I think software development skills are important for research. I like information security, writing good code, gamedev, digital art, and social justice. This is my personal blog! I have a lot of ðŸ˜¬opinionsðŸ˜¬ (my own) but I also write some ðŸŽ“tutorialsðŸŽ“.

And here are some software things I think are really cool or fascinating or fun or generally worth blogging about:

* Linux and its ecosystem. Bash! Git! SSH! All those wonderful tools!
* The [GNU Image Manipulation Program](https://www.gimp.org/)!
* HTML, CSS, and Gophers!
* System administration!
* Programming!
* Game development (with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) especially!)
