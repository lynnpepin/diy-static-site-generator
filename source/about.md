## About the Author and Blog

My name is Lynn Pepin (they/them). I'm a computer scientist grad student seeking my PhD at the Univerity of Connecticut! I do research and work a lot in Python, and I think software development skills are important for research. I like information security, writing good code, gamedev, digital art, and social justice. This is my personal blog! I have a lot of ðŸ˜¬opinionsðŸ˜¬ (my own) but I also write some ðŸŽ“tutorialsðŸŽ“.

And here are some software things I think are really cool or fascinating or fun or generally worth blogging about:

* Linux and its ecosystem. Bash! Git! SSH! All those wonderful tools!
* The [GNU Image Manipulation Program](https://www.gimp.org/)!
* HTML, CSS, and Gophers!
* System administration!
* Programming!
* Game development (with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) especially!)
