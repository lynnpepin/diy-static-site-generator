# Static Site Generator in 10 Minutes

A do-it-yourself approach to static site generation, using Pandoc.


## Questions

### It's not DIY if you use Pandoc!

True! In fact, this would take much more than 10 Minutes if we didn't use Pandoc. This is many layers of abstraction lower than using something like Jekyll or Hugo though.

### Why do you use Python and not Bash?

Because I like Python! It's easier for me to extend Python!

### But you call Pandoc from Python!

Yeah! It's easier that way!

### Gross!

Sorry (but not really.)
