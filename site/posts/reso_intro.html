<h1 class="title"> <code>reso</code>, a colorful pixel-art circuit
simulator</h1>

</header>

<p>Reso is a circuit design language and simulator where the inputs and
outputs are bitmap images!</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Reso logo, incrementing over a truth

</figure>
<p>Reso is a pet project of mine that I've been working on in my free
time for a little while. This logo is actually an animation of the
execution of a Reso circuit.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For the math nerds: Reso is a circuit design language and
simulator that allows you to define an undirected boolean computational
graph by connecting contiguous regions of colored elements in a 2D
map.</p></li>
<li><p>For the engineering nerds: Reso is a useless, slow,
minimal-feature digital logic simulator where you build wires and gates
out of pixels! Its only redeeming qualities are that it's fun, pretty,
and maybe a fun project to reimpliment in Rust.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Reso is inspired by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minecraft's Redstone</li>
<li>The Piet esoteric language</li>
<li>The many hours I spent debugging my awful Redstone circuit.</li>
<li>Python and C.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reso is inspired by Python in the sense that, just as Python is akin
to "executable pseudocode", Reso was inspired by wishing I could execute
bitmap-images that made my Redstone circuit.</p>
<p>Reso was inspired by C in the sense that C is simple enough that one
can understand it <em>entirely</em>. It's a small enough language to
hold every feature and the standard libraries in your head. I wanted
Reso to be the same in that regard.</p>
<p>Now, before I write more of this blog post, don't let me fool you!
Reso isn't good. I never intended for it to be good, actually, and
things don't need to be good. Reso is bad because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's inaccessible to those who are blind</li>
<li>It's inaccessible to those who are colorblind</li>
<li>It's inaccessible to those who have full color vision, because I
foolishly chose colors for elements that are way too similar on most
monitors. (Lime and teal).</li>
<li>It's very slow, because I prioritized code quality and readability
over speed</li>
<li>It's very slow, because I used Python</li>
<li>The code quality and readability is poor</li>
<li>It is not interactive, unlike actually useful digital logic design
software.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ew, right?! This means that Reso is software made <em>entirely for
fun!</em> And it isn't even a video game!</p>
<p>With that out of the way, I'm happy you're still reading this blog
post! Now that you have a good idea of why Reso is bad, let's get into
how to actually use it.</p>
<h1 id="reso-circuits-101">Reso circuits 101</h1>
<p>I'll assume you -- the reader -- is already familiar with digital
logic circuits. That is, you should be comfortable with:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What 'True' and 'False' means.</li>
<li>What <code>AND</code>, <code>XOR</code>, <code>OR</code>, and
<code>NOT</code> gates are.</li>
<li>The fact that you can build a computer from these if you put your
mind to it!!</li>
</ol>
<p>With that out of the way, let's get started!</p>
<h2 id="resos-10-color-palette">Reso's 10-color palette</h2>
<figure>
<img src="../images/reso_full_palette.png"
title="A full 24-color Reso palette"
alt="A full 24-color Reso palette" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A full 24-color Reso palette</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Reso circuits are defined by contiguous regions of pixels (called
Resels).</p>
<p>While we define 24 colors as "reserved", in practice, there are 10
colors that we use in Reso:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Color</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
<th>Hex code</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Bright orange</td>
<td>Orange wire (on)</td>
<td><code>#ff8000</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Dark orange</td>
<td>Orange wire (off)</td>
<td><code>#804000</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Bright sapphire</td>
<td>Sapphire wire (on)</td>
<td><code>#0080ff</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Dark sapphire</td>
<td>Sapphire wire (off)</td>
<td><code>#004080</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Bright lime</td>
<td>Lime wire (on)</td>
<td><code>#80ff00</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Dark lime</td>
<td>Lime wire (off)</td>
<td><code>#408000</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Bright purple</td>
<td>Output (node to wire)</td>
<td><code>#8000ff</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Dark purple</td>
<td>Input (wire to node)</td>
<td><code>#400080</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Bright teal</td>
<td>XOR logic node</td>
<td><code>#00ff80</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Dark teal</td>
<td>AND logic node</td>
<td><code>#008040</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Here is what the limited 10-color palette looks like:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/reso_mini_palette.png"
title="A mini 10-color Reso palette"
alt="A mini 10-color Reso palette" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A mini 10-color Reso palette</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Six of these colors (three hues, orange, sapphire, and lime, across
two tones, dark and bright) are dedicated to wires, which hold on or off
states.</p>
<p>Two colors (dark and bright teal) are dedicated to logical-AND and
logical-XOR.</p>
<p>It'd be nice if we could just connect a wire blob to, say, a
logical-XOR blob, but then we'd lack directionality! How would we tell
input from output wires? Reso circuits are defined by adjacencies of
pixel blobs, and that is inherently undirected.</p>
<p>So, to cheat, we use purple to add input and output nodes for logic.
This adds directionality as-needed. With that out of the way...</p>
<h1 id="logic-gates-in-reso">Logic gates in Reso</h1>
<p>... Let's discuss logic gates!</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/reso_basic_gates.png"
title="Four gates (and, or, not, xor) implemented in Reso."
alt="Four gates (and, or, not, xor) implemented in Reso." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Four gates (and, or, not, xor)
implemented in Reso.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This... This is pretty much it. Stare at it until it makes sense!
These are the four basic logic gates, as implemented in Reso. (Note that
the choice of wire color doesn't matter here.)</p>
<p>The magic of Reso is that you can copy-paste these all around. You
can perform any lossless transformation on it. Flip it, rotate it (by 90
degrees, of course), anything that doesn't interpolate pixel colors or
mess with contiguities of regions! This makes everything you make
entirely modular.</p>
<p>Note that the black and white pixels are <em>outside</em> of the
palette. They are semantically insignificant! You can use these colors
like comments or for diagrams, like I do here! You can make your
circuits sparse and readable, or you can tightly knit your gates
together.</p>
<h1 id="example-a-one-bit-adder.">Example: A one-bit adder.</h1>
<figure>
<img src="../images/reso_adder.png"
title="A one-bit half adder in Reso."
alt="A one-bit half adder in Reso." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A one-bit half adder in
Reso.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Here is an example of a one-bit half adder in Reso. It is implemented
in two ways: A "verbose" adder that labels inputs and outputs, and a
"mini" adder that is better suited for more tightly-knit circuits.</p>
<p>Note that the blue and orange wires here cross over one another
diagonally: A neat trick in Reso is that wires are the only elements for
which contiguity is defined on the diagonals.</p>
<h1 id="example-a-digital-clock">Example: A digital clock</h1>
<figure>
<img src="../images/reso_clock.png"
title="Three Reso clocks forming an 8 bit counter."
alt="Three Reso clocks forming an 8 bit counter." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Three Reso clocks forming an 8 bit
counter.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Clocks are rather easy to build for small periods. This is a small,
3-bit (8 value) counter, formed from three digital clocks. An
edge-triggered flip-flop can be used to double the period of a clock ,
but I didn't do that here, because these are small and simple
enough.</p>
<p>Note the timing of these things. We add an input/output pair at the
edge to prevent someone from accidentally messing with the clock from
setting the output wire "on". This causes a delay of one timestep, which
is accounted for in the design of the clock. The minimum period for a
clock is 2 timesteps (i.e. on for one timestep, off for one
timestep.)</p>
<h1 id="the-rest">The rest?</h1>
<p>So, you can totally build a computer in this and all sorts of other
wacky things! It is Turing Complete, after all. But this is an
introductory blog post.</p>
