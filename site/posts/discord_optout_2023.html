<blockquote>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Send an email to <a
href="mailto:arbitration-opt-out@discord.com">arbitration-opt-out@discord.com</a>
using the email associated with your Discord account. For good measure,
add your username. Template below!</p>

<h1
id="everyone-should-opt-out-of-forced-arbitration-clauses-every-time.-heres-why">Everyone
should opt out of "forced arbitration clauses," every time. Here's
why</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> A forced arbitration clause is when a company
says, "Hey, if you have a problem with us, you can't sue us. Sorry
sucker! Instead, you have to go through arbitration. Kind of like Judge
Judy, except it's not fun, and we get to pick the Judge Judy. We almost
always win." You usually can't even join a class action lawsuit if
you've signed one of these bad boys.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Forced arbitration clauses in the US are a tactic used by
corporations which ask you to sign away your right to sue in court, and
instead, go through an "arbitrator" of the corporations choosing. This
is entirely against your best interest.</p>
<p>Corporations started testing the legal waters with these "arbitration
clauses". Unfortunately, these clauses were regularly held up by courts
of law. This has emboldened companies to create increasingly restrictive
arbitration clauses that increasingly restrict your right to sue. It has
gotten worse with the Trump administration and the far-right
conservative US Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Arbitration clauses are here to stay, and they're regularly enforced.
<strong>Arbitration clauses are regularly enforced in the courts of law,
and are not in your favor.</strong> You owe it to yourself to defend
yourself from these.</p>
<p>You can learn more <a
href="https://www.epi.org/research/forced-arbitration/">at epi.org
here,</a> <a
href="https://www.epi.org/publication/the-arbitration-epidemic/">here,</a>
<a
href="https://www.epi.org/publication/correcting-the-record-consumers-fare-better-under-class-actions-than-arbitration/">and
here.</a>.</p>
<p>My stance is this: <strong>Nobody should ever agree to arbitration.
Every person with a Discord account should opt out.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The average consumer pays $7,725 in arbitration.
<ul>
<li>This is from 2017 and not adjusted for inflation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Consumers (you) win in arbitration 21% of the time versus 57% in a
real court of law.
<ul>
<li>This is sourced from 2015, before the Trump administration and the
Trump-appointees to the Supreme Court. The win rate is likely much lower
now in 2023.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When consumers win in arbitration, they receive on average $24K in
damages, down from $328K.
<ul>
<li>That is a 13.7x decrease.</li>
<li>This is also sourced from 2015. This disparity likely much greater
now in 2023.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>But how can you opt out of Discord's arbitration clause?</p>
<h1
id="you-can-opt-out-of-discords-arbitration-clause-by-sending-them-an-email">You
can opt out of Discord's arbitration clause by sending them an
email</h1>
<p>Send an email to <a
href="mailto:arbitration-opt-out@discord.com">arbitration-opt-out@discord.com</a>,
from the <strong>email address you use for your account</strong>,
stating you wish to opt out of the arbitration clause. For good measure,
I recommend adding your account ID!</p>
<p>Here's the email I wrote. Go ahead and fill in your email and
username below, with the numbers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To Discord,</p>
<p>I am <strong>declining the agreement to arbitrate</strong> and I am
<strong>decliing the class-action waiver</strong> in the new Discord
Terms of Service.</p>
<p>I am sending this from my email ✨email here✨, associated with my
account ✨username here✨.</p>
<p>Specifically, I am referring to the new Discord terms of service
posted at https://discord.com/terms on 2023 February 24, effective 2023
March 27. I am opting out of the arbitration clause, and I am stating my
disagreement to the class-action waivers, per section 14 "Settling
disputes between you and Discord"</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>✨signature here too✨.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>You should do this every time Discord changes their Terms of
Service.</strong> This is an unjust world, and you are your best
advocate! This is Discord's way of covering their own asses, for
example, to avoid accountability for bots which scrape your messages
from public channels to share them publicly (<a
href="https://gist.github.com/resynth1943/0185f55207dc4d84be99c8d74da9221d#file-dear_discord-txt">since
2019 or earlier</a>), or to avoid accountability when white supremacists
Trump supporters organize deadly movements using Discord and commit mass
shootings (<a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/technology/discord-chat-app-alt-right.html">2017</a>,
<a
href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/10/discord-safe-space-white-supremacists.html">2018</a>,
<a
href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2019/neo-nazi-hipsters-identity-evropa-exposed-in-discord-chat-leak/">2019</a>),
<a
href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2022/highland-park-shooter-decried-commies-in-discord-chat/">2022</a>,
or to avoid accountability for any other thing their corporation might
do to you that you can't even imagine right now.)</p>
