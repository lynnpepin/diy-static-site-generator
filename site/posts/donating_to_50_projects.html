<p><strong>Tldr:</strong> In 2020, I did a lot of charitable giving but got a lot of spam in return, so in 2021 I am focusing on small projects that I don’t expect to spam me. This also makes a good opportunity to showcase smaller projects that I use! Most of them (so far) use LibrePay, Ko-Fi, or PayPal. As of 2021 January 25th, I’ve donated <strong>$125</strong> across <strong>five different projects</strong>, with <strong>no spam received!</strong> Just standard receipts/thank-yous received shortly after the donation. :)</p>

<hr />
<p>Over the course of 2020, I donated a sum of about $3000 to a lot of different organizations and projects that I consider to be useful, good, or important. I came to regret this as many of them sent me spam, both digitally to my email address and physically to my home address.</p>
<p>Those few who received my money without spamming me back included Signal and GrapheneOS. The only communications I received from them were receipts. I also donated to the EFF and FSF, but I enthusiastically consented to those communications!</p>
<p>This year, due to some financial hardships, I’m lowering my goal of $3000 in charitable giving to around $1200. (I am a graduate student, after all.) After reading <a href="https://gourav.io/blog/first-donation-on-open-source-side-project">“I received first-ever donation on my open-source side project and it felt great!” (gourav.io/blog/first-donation-on-open-source-side-project)</a> by Gourav Goyal, and after being burnt out on spam, I figured I’d split this $1200 over 50 different organizations or open source projects over a year. I’ll track how much spam I get here.</p>
<p>The focus will be on small projects or single developers. This will give me the opportunity to highlight small projects, and also to shame those that send me spam! :)</p>
<p>I’ll update this blogpost with links to other blogposts as well.</p>
<p><strong>I’ll update this with new blogposts throughout the year, highlighting different projects, and the amount of communications / spam I receive after donating to them.</strong> “Spam” will be any communications beyond a receipt and thank-you that I didn’t explicitly and obviously consent to receive.</p>
<p>I noticed that Ko-Fi, PayPal, and Librepay were the most common donation sources, and most of these were non tax-exempt.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/">StreetComplete (github.com/streetcomplete)</a> is an Android app that allows users to contribute information to Open Street Map. You earn points by answering questions to complete “quests”. It’s like Pokemon Go, but you help to map the world a round you!</p>
<p>Questions include, “Is this stretch of way lit?”, “What surface does this path have here?”, or “What are the opening hours of this building?”</p>
<p>I made my first donation of 2021 on January 13th to westnordost, the developer of StreetComplete, using LiberaPay (liberapay.com/westnordost). I set it as a $25/year manually-recurring donation, with confirmation first. :)</p>
<p><strong>Communications received as of January 20th:</strong> 1. Email address verification from Liberapay</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="donation-2-nextcloud-notes-android-app"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Donation 2: NextCloud Notes (Android app)</h1>

<p>NextCloud (<a href="nextcloud.com">nextcloud.com</a>) is a self-hosted alternative to various cloud providers, e.g. Google. Its functionality is extended through independently-developed free apps. Nextcloud itself may be a “big project”, but the ecosystem is full of small devs!</p>
<p>The dev of the NextCloud Notes Android app <a href="github.com/stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-notes">(github.com/stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-notes)</a> has a LiberaPay presence. I’m currently using the Android app to write this post, and he has been pretty quick in responding to bug reports / issues I’ve had in the past. The Notes app was <em>fundamental</em> in my de-google process, so I made a €25/year manually-recurring donation.</p>
<p>As a side note, I paid €25 to this project by mistake, which is about $32. I make it up by paying only $18 to this next project. :)</p>
<p><strong>Communications received as of January 25th:</strong> 1. PayPal receipt 2. Thank you email for donation</p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="donation-3-liberapay"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Donation 3: LiberaPay</h1>
<p>I’ve been using LiberaPay so far for most of these developers, which seems to be a popular alternative to Patreon which does not take cuts. I also noticed that I paid €25 (about $32) on the last project. I want to support LiberaPay and keep it existing, so I’m cutting the difference and paying $18 to support LiberaPay. Again, I do this with a $25/year manually recurring donation.</p>
<p><strong>Communications received as of January 25th:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>None!</em> No communications were received for this donation. Very refreshing.</li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="4" id="donation-4-signal"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Donation 4: Signal</h1>
<p>On January 15th, Signal suffered a major outage after gaining tens of millions of followers over the course of a few days. While Signal is certainly a “big player”, I’m very invested in it, so I donated $25 to it. You can do so as well at <a href="https://signal.org/donate/">signal.org/donate</a></p>
<p><strong>Communications received as of January 25th:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Donorbox Receipt</li>

<h1 data-number="5" id="donation-5-grapheneos"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Donation 5: GrapheneOS</h1>
<p>On January 25th, I paid a donation to support GrapheneOS. GrapheneOS is a hardened de-Googled Android. Unlike many custom roms, Graphene offers the ability to lock the bootloader on Google Pixel phones. (The only other project that I know of which does that is CalyxOS.) You can check out the project at <a href="https://grapheneos.org/">grapheneos.org</a>.</p>
<p>(By the way– when donating, add a note that it is for the GrapheneOS project, for record-keeping. PayPal does not allow multiple personal accounts I forgot to add a note when I donated.)</p>
<p><strong>Communications received as of January 25th:</strong></p>
