<h1 id="projects-that-ive-done">Projects That I’ve Done</h1>
<!-- TODO: Photos, goal of <100KB each, 1MB max, or optional load-photos -->
<p>This is an incomplete list of projects that I’ve worked on, and think are nice enough to mention here. :)</p>
<h2 id="ongoing-projects">Ongoing Projects</h2>
<p>These are projects that I am still working on (as of December 2020).</p>
<!-- TODO Blog photo -->
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/lynnpepin/diy-static-site-generator"><strong>This blog</strong></a>, 2020-present, Python, HTML, CSS. Using Pandoc for the real work, this is a quick-and-dirty static site generator! I started this in 2020 to learn basic web design. I like to think I made a minimal, lightweight, and nice looking static site. :)</p>
<!-- TODO Snippets photo -->
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/lynnpepin/some_snippets"><strong>Python Snippets</strong></a>, 2019-ongoing, Python (mostly). A small collection of mostly-Python snippets, tricks, or writeups. Sometimes for others benefit, sometimes my own. Nothing too fancy here!</p>
<!-- TODO, finish, GNU TCG -->
<p><strong>Gnu-TCG</strong>, 2020-ongoing is a small GIMP Python (PythonFu) script to automate editing for a trading card game. Rather than editing and exporting every card by hand, make a .CSV file and use a script like this to get done what you need done!</p>
<!-- ## Research Publications -->
<!-- TODO -->
<!-- ## Finished Projects and Course Projects

<!-- TODO PRAW cleanup, photo -->
<!-- **Overwrite Reddit Comments**, 2019, Python. A script using [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to facilitate mass-deleting Reddit comments.


<!-- TODO NLP photo -->
<!-- **NLP for automated testing**, 2017-2018, Python, Keras, spaCy. A senior design team project I completed UConn with other students. I worked as engineering team lead as we worked on a tool to process human-language testing instructions to automatable tests.

<!-- TODO -->
<!-- **Java Swift UI, CSE 2012** https://github.com/lynnpepin/cse2102 todo

<!-- TODO -->
<!-- **MIPS sim** https://github.com/lynnpepin/mips-simulator

<!-- TODO -->
<!-- **OS 161** https://github.com/lynnpepin/4300os161


<!-- TODO: Image, change credits to Lynn Pepin -->
<!-- **Bython** https://github.com/lynnpepin/bython -->
<!--  I contributed a major change to Bython, a Python preprocessor that translates curly brakcets into indentatioin. -->
<h2 id="finished-proof-of-concepts">Finished Proof-of-Concepts</h2>
<p>These are a collection of proof-of-concept projects that I did to teach myself a new skill or out of curiosity! Source code is provided, so feel free to poke around.</p>
<!-- TODO Rolling Log photo -->
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/lynnpepin/rollinglogshader"><strong>Rolling Log “Animal Crossing” shader</strong></a>, 2020, Godot. This is a simple vertex shader that recreates the “rolling log” effect that is popular in the Animal Crossing series. Watch as your planar world wraps itself over an invisible cylinder, and hangs as if cloth!</p>
<!-- TODO Reso photo -->
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/lynnpepin/reso"><strong>Reso</strong></a>, 2018, Python. is a graph-automata circuit-programming language inspired by redstone and wireworld. It is Turing complete, but not very pretty to use. I might revisit this later, it’d be better if it was interactive, web-based, and would interact with GPIO pins (say, on a Raspberry Pi)!</p>
<!-- TODO RGBLife, Brainbow -->
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/lynnpepin/RGBLife"><strong>RGBLife</strong></a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/lynnpepin/brainbow-ca"><strong>Brainbow</strong></a>, 2017-2018, Python. These are both cellular automata with four states (red, green, blue, and dead) with some neat behavior. By the way, I learned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">“test-driven development” (TDD)</a> when working on these these projects. I highly TDD to anyone who hasn’t tried it, it really improved the way I code. :)</p>
<!--## Language Experience

TODO

Python: Most recent

Mostly for coursework: Java: 

Only for coursework: SML, Scheme (Dr. Racket, taught it!), more todo

## TODO

 * Publish `overwrite-reddit-comments`
 * Contribute to GIMP
 * IRSSI doc contributions
