<!-- TODO: Photos, goal of <100KB each, 1MB max, or optional load-photos -->
<p>This is an incomplete list of projects that I’ve worked on, and think are nice enough to mention here. :)</p>
<h2 id="ongoing-projects">Ongoing Projects</h2>
<p>These are projects that I am still working on (as of December 2020).</p>

<!-- TODO Blog photo -->
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/lynnpepin/diy-static-site-generator">📝This blog📝</a>, 2020-present, Python, HTML, CSS. Using Pandoc for the real work, this is a quick-and-dirty static site generator! I started this in 2020 to learn basic web design. I like to think I made a minimal, lightweight, and nice looking static site. :)</p>

<!-- TODO Snippets photo -->
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/lynnpepin/some_snippets">🐍Python Snippets🐍</a>, 2019-ongoing, Python (mostly). A small collection of mostly-Python snippets, tricks, or writeups. Sometimes for others benefit, sometimes my own. Nothing too fancy here!</p>

<p><strong>Apocalypse Sirens</strong>, 2020-ongoing is a small GIMP Python (PythonFu) script to automate editing for a trading card game. Rather than editing and exporting every card by hand, make a .CSV file and use a script like this to get done what you need done!</p>

<!-- **Overwrite Reddit Comments**, 2019, Python. A script using [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to facilitate mass-deleting Reddit comments.


<!-- TODO NLP photo -->
<!-- **NLP for automated testing**, 2017-2018, Python, Keras, spaCy. A senior design team project I completed UConn with other students. I worked as engineering team lead as we worked on a tool to process human-language testing instructions to automatable tests.

<p>These are a collection of proof-of-concept projects that I did to teach myself a new skill or out of curiosity! Source code is provided, so feel free to poke around.</p>

<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/lynnpepin/rollinglogshader">🪵Rolling Log “Animal Crossing” shader🪵</a>, 2020, Godot. This is a simple vertex shader that recreates the “rolling log” effect that is popular in the Animal Crossing series. Watch as your planar world wraps itself over an invisible cylinder, and hangs as if cloth!</p>

<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/lynnpepin/reso">⛏️ Reso⛏️</a>, 2018, Python. is a graph-automata circuit-programming language inspired by redstone and wireworld. It is Turing complete, but not very pretty to use. I might revisit this later, it’d be better if it was interactive, web-based, and would interact with GPIO pins (say, on a Raspberry Pi)!</p>

<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/lynnpepin/RGBLife">🐛RGBLife🐛</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/lynnpepin/brainbow-ca">🧠Brainbow🧠</a>, 2017-2018, Python. These are both cellular automata with four states (red, green, blue, and dead) with some neat behavior. By the way, I learned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">“test-driven development”</a> (TDD) when working on these these projects. I highly TDD to anyone who hasn’t tried it, it really improved the way I code. :)</p>
