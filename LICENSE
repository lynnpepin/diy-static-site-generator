Not-legal stuff:

Fonts in `site/fonts` are downloaded from fonts.google.com and are licensed under the [Open Font License](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL). I didn't make them.

The example posts have a license in the footer-- you'll probably want to change that before publishing.

This static site generator and its style are licensed under the [MIT license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/). A site you make using this are not licensed under the MIT license (unless you want them to be.)

Legal stuff: MIT License
